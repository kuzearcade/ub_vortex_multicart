# BackToMenu Patch for UNIBIOS 4.0

- UNIBIOS created by [Razoola](http://unibios.free.fr)
- Initial patch by [ArcadeTV](https://github.com/ArcadeTV/neogeo-menu)
- Multicart by [Vortex](https://github.com/xvortex/VTXCart)

---

This aims to bring back a "Back To Menu" option for the custom 161in1 cart based on the work of Vortex.

## Patching

1. Obtain the [UNIBIOS 4.0 ROM](http://unibios.free.fr/download/uni-bios-40.zip).
2. Use the BPS patch file to patch your ROM. I recommend [FLIPS](https://dl.smwcentral.net/11474/floating.zip).

## What was altered from the original UNIBIOS ?

---

Keeping B pressed while soft rebooting from the in game menu will make the multicart boot on the menu.
